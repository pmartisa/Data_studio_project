# State sponsored athletics and steroid abuse,the key to Soviet success in the Winter Olympics
XXIV Winter Olympics in Beijing are currently happening!<br>
On this project we analyze the history of the Winter Olympics since 1960, and explore the Soviet dominance during the Cold War era calculating the rate of number of medals achieved per athlete competing.

<h2>Where do our data come from?</h2>
 <p>We have extracted the data from the offical<a href="https://olympics.com/"> Olympics website</a>, and also, created our own dataset with the top medalist countries since 1960 to 2018. Finally, we extracted from the historial dataset <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results">'120 years of Olympic data' </a>the team size of each Olympic cohort overtime.</p>

<h2>Some data-analysis findings</h2>
Only the Soviet Union and East Germany have achieved the highest number of medals in relation to the number of national athletes registered. Already in 1960 the URSS was the only country to get more than 20 medals with a team of 62 athletes (with a rate of 2.95 athletes per medal).
<br>
This achievement was similarly accomplished by East Germany in the eighties, reaching a rate of 2.33 athletes per medal in the Winter games of Sarajevo in 1984. 
</br>
Only the Netherlands, from a dataset with the top Winter Olympics countries according to the medal tally, have repeatedly performed with a better medal rate. Last games, in 2018, this small European nation accumulated a total of 20 medals with a full team of 33 athletes.

<h2>What did I learn?</h2>
I merged two different datasets, after having cleanned the rows I wasn't interested in as well as all the info. related to other Olympic countries my analysis wasn't focused on. I used Flourish to plot my results for the first time, creating some interactive graphics. Also, for the first time, I was very conscious of the final format my dataset should have in order to being able to plot it the way I wanted. 

<h2>What didn't work?</h2>
I couldn't manage to scrape a short table with some medals information, so I ended up persuing a (looong) manual process.
